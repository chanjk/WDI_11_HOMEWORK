# Stock App
#
# Build a Sinatra App that will take a stock symbol and display the stock price
# The stock symbol e.g. APPL should be inputted via the url as query string
# The result should be rendered in the browswer with ERB.
# The background colour should be mistyrose.
# Suggested Approach
#
# Build a Sinatra application
#
# Include:
# app.rb
# views/index.erb
# public/styles.css
# Define a method that makes a request to the YahooFinance api via the YahooFinance gem.
#
# This method should take, as paramater, a stock ticker
# This method should return data about the stock
# Test this method manually in pry
# Display, for example, google's stock price when there is GET request to /?stock=APPL
#
# The file should be index.erb
# All the above should work without the need of any form input.
#
# Example yahoofinance library usage:
#
# require 'yahoofinance'
# result = YahooFinance::get_quotes(YahooFinance::StandardQuote, 'MSFT')


require 'pry'
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/reloader'
require 'yahoofinance'

get '/' do
  erb :index
end

get '/result' do
  result = YahooFinance::get_quotes(YahooFinance::StandardQuote, params[:input])
  @stock = result[params[:input]].lastTrade
  @company_name = result[params[:input]].name
  erb :index
end
